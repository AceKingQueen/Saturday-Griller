### [Saturday Griller](https://calm-inlet-44967.herokuapp.com/)

Saturday-Griller is a full stack application that lets users input the names of foods they'd like to grill. It is built using the MVC design pattern. 

The user submits a food's name and chooses whether to "throw it on the grill" or "save it for later" using the buttons. 

The added food item is then stored in a database, whether grilled or saved for later.

The user can also make changes to either list using the buttons next to each food item.

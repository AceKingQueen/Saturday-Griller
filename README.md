# [Saturday Griller](https://calm-inlet-44967.herokuapp.com/)

Saturday-Griller is a full stack application that lets users input the names of foods they'd like to grill. It is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design architecture. 

I would spend every Saturday grilling, if I could. I love figuring out how to grill new foods and perfecting old recipes. 

This website has simple styling on the front end, because the real work was on the back end. This is the first full stack application I've built and deployed. I struggled with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)'s templating code at first, but working through these issues prepared me to take on related concepts I'd need for working with [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

_My biggest problem_ in building this website was staying organized! The full-stack folder structure looks daunting at first, but it's important to know what info is going where when working building a site front to back.

### How to Use

The user submits a food and chooses whether to "throw it on the grill" or "save it for later" using the buttons. 

The added food item is then stored in a database, whether grilled or saved for later.

The user can also make changes to either list using the buttons next to each food item.
